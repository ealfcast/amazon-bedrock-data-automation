The publication is based on data provided by Federal entities, disbursing officers, and Federal Reserve banks.\n\n## AUDIENCE\n\nThe MTS is published to meet the needs of those responsible for or interested in the cash position of the Treasury, those who are responsible or interested in the Government's budget results; and individuals and businesses whose operations depend upon or are related to the Government's financial operations.\n\n## DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\n\nThis statement summarizes the financial activities of the Federal Government and off-budget Federal entities conducted in accordance with the Budget of the U.S. Government, i.e., receipts and outlays of funds, the surplus or deficit, and the means of financing the deficit or disposing of the surplus. Information is presented on a modified cash basis; receipts are accounted for on the basis of collections; refunds of receipts are treated as deductions from gross receipts; revolving and management fund receipts, reimbursements and refunds of monies previously expended are treated as deductions from gross outlays; and interest on the public debt (public issues) is recognized on the accrual basis. Major information sources include accounting data reported by Federal entities, disbursing officers, and Federal Reserve banks.\n\n## TRIAD OF PUBLICATIONS\n\nThe MTS is part of a triad of Treasury financial reports. The Daily Treasury Statement is published each working day of the Federal Government. It provides data on the cash and debt operations of the Treasury based upon reporting of the Treasury account balances by Federal Reserve banks. The MTS is a report of Government receipts and outlays, based on agency reporting. The Combined Statement of Receipts, Outlays, and Balances of the United States Government is the official publication of the detailed receipts and outlays of the Government. It is published annually in accordance with legislative mandates given to the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n## DATA SOURCES AND INFORMATION\n\nThe Explanatory Notes section of this publication provides information concerning the flow of data into the MTS and sources of information relevant to the MTS.\n\n3"

The publication is based on data provided by Federal entities, disbursing officers, and Federal Reserve banks.\n\n## AUDIENCE\n\nThe MTS is published to meet the needs of those responsible for or interested in the cash position of the Treasury, those who are responsible or interested in the Government's budget results; and individuals and businesses whose operations depend upon or are related to the Government's financial operations.\n\n## DISCLOSURE STATEMENT\n\nThis statement summarizes the financial activities of the Federal Government and off-budget Federal entities conducted in accordance with the Budget of the U.S. Government, i.e., receipts and outlays of funds, the surplus or deficit, and the means of financing the deficit or disposing of the surplus. Information is presented on a modified cash basis; receipts are accounted for on the basis of collections; refunds of receipts are treated as deductions from gross receipts; revolving and management fund receipts, reimbursements and refunds of monies previously expended are treated as deductions from gross outlays; and interest on the public debt (public issues) is recognized on the accrual basis. Major information sources include accounting data reported by Federal entities, disbursing officers, and Federal Reserve banks.\n\n## TRIAD OF PUBLICATIONS\n\nThe MTS is part of a triad of Treasury financial reports. The Daily Treasury Statement is published each working day of the Federal Government. It provides data on the cash and debt operations of the Treasury based upon reporting of the Treasury account balances by Federal Reserve banks. The MTS is a report of Government receipts and outlays, based on agency reporting. The Combined Statement of Receipts, Outlays, and Balances of the United States Government is the official publication of the detailed receipts and outlays of the Government. It is published annually in accordance with legislative mandates given to the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n## DATA SOURCES AND INFORMATION\n\nThe Explanatory Notes section of this publication provides information concerning the flow of data into the MTS and sources of information relevant to the MTS.\n\n3"
